Post-Build Actions:
- Convert NUnit XML report into a readable HTML page
- Convert OpenCover XML report into readable HTML pages using ReportGenerator
- Scan MSBuild compiler log for warnings and publish report to Jenkins
- Publish NUnit test result report to Jenkins job build
- Publish converted Cobertura code coverage report to Jenkins job build
- Publish generated HTML report pages  to Jenkins job build
- Send build notifications to Slack channel
